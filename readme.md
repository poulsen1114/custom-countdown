# Countdown Timer

This is a countdown timer application that allows users to set a countdown for a specific date and time. The application provides a user interface to input the countdown details, displays the countdown in progress, and shows a completion message when the countdown has ended.

## Features

- Set the countdown title and date.
- Display the countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Hide the input form during the countdown.
- Show a completion message when the countdown has ended.
- Reset the countdown and input values.
- Automatic restoration of the previous countdown from local storage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/poulsen1114/custom-countdown.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How It Works

1. The user can enter a countdown title and select a date using the provided form.
2. Upon submitting the form, the countdown details are saved to local storage.
3. The countdown timer is started, and it updates the UI every second to show the remaining time.
4. If the countdown reaches zero (i.e., the selected date and time have passed), a completion message is displayed.
5. The user can reset the countdown and input values by clicking the "Reset" button.
